There will be people going cuckoo for my cuckoos
Shoppers will be flocking to my shop
Just a strain of that refrain will increase our fiscal gain
They'll be lining up around the block
Courtesy of nimble little fingers
Little urchins working round the clock
They were worthless as can be
Now they're happy can't you see?
As they help me to increase my stock

"What a fancy clock," they'll say
Any price I set, they'll pay
With a tune their hearts desire
It's a Flouglemire

"What a wondеrful song," they'll say
As it takes their brеath away
With a melody to entice
They'll pay any price!

We'll export them out to England, France, and China
They'll adore them in the northern ports of Spain
Yes a bonafide sensation
As they enter every nation
We'll be riding on the gravy train
We'll be mopping up the money in the morning
We'll be rolling in our riches, afternoon
In the evening we'll dine on the finest food and wine
And we'll eat it with a silver spoon

"What a fancy spoon," they'll say
("Can I take your coat?") You may
("He's a cuckoo clock supplier, Mr. Flouglemire")

And we're sorry but no COD
But we offer a full warranty
But the warranty has expired
You've been Flouglemired (Ha!)

"What a fancy clock," they'll shout
As they pull their purses out
Everyone will go berserk
Now get these urchins back to work!
:I see you
You see me
How pleasant
This feeling
The moment
You hold me
I missed you
I'm sorry
I've given
What I have
I showed you
I'm growing
The ashes
Fall slowly
As your voice
Consoles me

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

We're swaying
To drum beats
In motion
I'm feeling
My patience
Controlling
The question
I won't speak
We're telling
The stories
Our laughter
He knows me
We're leaving
We're talking
You're closer
It's calming

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

The night will hold us close
And the stars will guide us home
I've been waiting for this moment
We're finally alone
I turn to ask the question
So anxious, my thoughts
Your lips were soft like winter
In your passion, I was lost

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
:If you give a listen
You sweet little kitten
Sittin' downstairs in your room
Wood-panel walls
Rock posters from the mall
Playing just for you

When the house lights dim and the show begins
All the aliens touch down on stage
If we could read the script of our future
We would never turn the page
Live forever in a day

All by yourself
All by yourself
You can change everything
All by yourself

All by yourself
All by yourself
You're the queen, you're the king
All by yourself

You always hated sports
You buzzed your hair short
Dyed it pink to piss them off
With a hand-poke tattoo
That made a monster outta you
But you're beautiful, you're tough

When the summer ends and school's back in
You feel trapped in the afterglow
Three minutes thirty seconds of a rock and roll record
Is all you need to know
Live forever in a day

All by yourself
All by yourself
You can change everything
All by yourself

All by yourself
All by yourself
You're the queen, you're the king
All by yourself

You and me
It's you and me, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We live forever
We live forever

You and me
It's you and me
We're gonna live forever in a day
Yeah, yeah, yeah

All by yourself
All by yourself
You can change everything
All by yourself

All by yourself (all by yourself)
All by yourself
You're the queen, you're the king
All by yourself
:I hate my work, but I'm in control
I'm fearless now, but it cost my soul
Save yourselves, the moon is full
Under its power, gravitational pull

Blood red lips, they shake like leaves
You're flesh and blood, but what's underneath?

Don't turn out the lights
Kiss yourself goodnight cause there's a killer
And he's coming after you
Kiss yourself goodnight, tonight
Cause there's a killer and he's coming after you

It's alright to scream
I'm screaming too,
Why'd you think I do these things I do?
For shadows haunted me like ghosts,
So I became what I feared the most

I conduct fear like electricity
A man made monstrosity

Don't turn out the lights
Kiss yourself goodnight cause there's a killer
And he's coming after you
Kiss yourself goodnight, tonight
Cause there's a killer and he's coming after you

Oh oh, oh oh

Don't turn out the lights
Kiss yourself goodnight cause there's a killer
And he's coming after you
Kiss yourself goodnight, tonight
Cause there's a killer and he's coming after you

Don't turn out the lights, kiss yourself goodnight
Cause there's a killer and he's coming after you
Don't turn out the lights, tonight cause there's a killer

Oh oh, oh oh
:They've sped up to the point where they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
Plenty of desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen
They've sped up to the point where they provoke
You to tell the ****** punchline before you have told the joke
Well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the Top 100 list

And it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told ya, but you were dying for it

Saw it and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
Do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
Do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
That says that we are defenders
Of any poseur or professional pretender around

When did your list replace the twist and turn
Like a fist replaced the kiss?
Don't concern us with your bollocks, I don't want your prayer
Save it for the morning after

And it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told ya, but you were gagging for it

Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker
Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker

Presuming that all things are equal
Who'd want to be men of the people
When there's people like you?
:I declare war
On anybody standing in the way of what I dream for
How could you ignore
The ones that are voiceless, screams from the poor
They only here to score
I do it for the underground kings that'll need more
I'm kickin' down your door
If I wonder why you got a pocket full of green for
It's all about the get back
It's hard to give back while the politicians kick back
They say I'm only brick rap
Well that’s the foundation of this mountain that I live at
I can get you kidnapped
These kids ain't playin' with you, actin' like you live rap
And all those little mishaps
That only happen to you misfits, I'm here to fix that

Time to dig up your grave
Make it lower your voice
I told you not to play with the misfit toys
We running this gang
Getting sick of your noise
You stranded with a bad bunch of misfit toys

Rich get richer while the poor pickpocket
Swipes Maxwell 'til the cops come knockin'
Have or have not, bein’ broke is not an option
Time after time when you got a thing for watches
When you the plug in the socket
And the powers that be can't stop it
So obnoxious, borderline toxic
Both sides go to war like a mosh pit
Now let me switch up the optics
Our neighborhoods held us hostage
Some nights we slept in our closets
Gun fights was outside the projects
So you can't blame me for nonsense
I'm here to collect deposits
All else defies the logic
My people need me beside them

Time to dig up your grave
Make it lower your voice
I told you not to play with the misfit toys
We running this gang
Getting sick of your noise
You stranded with a bad bunch of misfit toys

Don't play with the misfits
Come play with the misfits
Don't play with the misfits
Come and play with the misfits

I told you don't play with the misfits
Must be deaf dumb and blind you a triplet
Don't you make me erase your existence
All by my lonely need no assistance
Any disrespect gets met with a vengeance
Burn down gossip and hidden agendas
We set the tone for all to remember
You rewrite history the greatest pretenders

You rewrite history the greatest pretenders

Time to dig up your grave
Make it lower your voice
I told you not to play with the misfit toys
We running this gang
Getting sick of your noise
You stranded with a bad bunch of misfit toys

Don't play with the misfits
Come play with the misfits
You stranded with a bad bunch of misfit toys
:Although it's right to stay and fight
The two of us are not quite fortified
With the battle of our lives on the horizon
Neophytes, we're none the wiser
I can testify, we won't survive

For are we scarecrows, or sentinels?
Standing strong or faux men nailed down to a pole?
Will we ever grow a proper sense of panic
In a world so inorganic
Or do you suppose, we're straw-filled clothes?

For the way we were was the way we learned to live
We couldn't give the things we never had to give
But when we fall we might ascend
And begin again

Maybe alone we have no hope
But if we run and see the world left to its own
Heaven knows that if we flee for our survival
Peace would leave on our arrival
Oh no, we left behind our shameless minds

For the way we were was the way we learned to live
We couldn't give the things we never had to give
But when we fall we may ascend
And begin again

Remember when you find my bones
Remember that I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
And when my ashes fall like snow
Remember that I told you so
I told you so
I told you so

Though they've begun to load their guns
As long as breath still fills the chambers of our lungs
You will find a shouting truth as from a turret
See if faith can stop a bullet
Watch the broken rise with stronger spines

They're Lazarus, the last of us
The comatose, the dearest friends we ever lost
Lift your head and see a tree become a forest
Our duet becomes a chorus
We can feel the rush of your own blood

For the way we were was the way we learned to live
We couldn't give the things we never had to give
But when we fall we may ascend
And begin again...
:Hiding in the fog
Where darkness meets the moonlight
I will sing a melody 'til the morning comes
Living for you only
Take my hand and show me
There will be much sorrow when the morning comes

Fearless I'm fighting the pain burns inside of me
Find the forces of my soul
No one can understand me
Am I condemned to ride the blackest night alone?

Tragic painting on the walls
In this castle where affliction reigns
So many died in vain
Hear their distant cries
Never again

This is my symphony
My dark blessing falls from the skies
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
I'll find my peace another way
Under the stars where we'll shine again some day

Torment and sadness unleashed through these corridors
Fear is leading to the night
Bloodline of vampires doomed to fulfill their need
Once united by the light
Father look into my eyes
I shall kill you tonight to avenge
All those who died in vain
Hear their distant cries
Never again

This is my symphony
My dark blessing falls from the skies
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
I'll find my peace another way
Under the stars where we'll shine again some day

This is my symphony
My dark blessing falls from the skies
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
I'll find my peace another way
Under the stars where we'll shine again some day

To the stars where we'll shine again some day
To the stars where we'll shine again some day
:I think it's time for you to know the awful truth
Mm, the truth about me, and the truth about you
'Cause you're a brand-new species
Big cat (oh-oh), space Nazis, Robert Stack (oh, oh)
God-damn it, gonna snap, Leonard Nimoy (oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Call me back (call me back)

I try to call you every day
I'm rehearsing what to say when the truth comes out (of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight, everybody's gonna hear me out

'Cause I'm the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I'm the only one
On your AM, AM radio

Oh, I'm crying now, authentic tears
They flow out of me when I think about you
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand the meaning of this
Oh my god
I try, and I try, and I try to make you listen to me

I try to call you every day
I'm rehearsing what to say when the truth comes out (of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight, everybody's gonna hear me out

'Cause I'm the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I'm the only one (hey)
On your AM, AM radio

Don't hang up yet, I'm not done
I'm an expert, I'm the one
The one who was right all along
Better to be laughed at than wrong

I'm an expert in my field
UFOlogy, yes, it's all real
Ancient aliens, it's all true
I'm an expert just like you

And like you, I'm a genius before my time
Disbelieving, that's the real crime
Pretty soon, they'll discover me
In the Super-Sargasso Sea

I try to call you every day
What can I say when the truth comes out? (Of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight, everybody's gonna hear me out (now)

'Cause I'm the right one (now) on my touch-tone telephone (now)
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I'm the only one on your AM radio
(On your AM, AM radio)
:We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes, "I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago"

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
